         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons Houſe of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, having in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Seſſion applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54410:3"/>to the aiding Your Majeſty in Your Naval Preparations, have of late conſidered of ſome Bills, that may be moſt grateful to the People, either in redreſſing things that are grievous to them, or in advancing their Trade and Commerce, which are the ſoul and life of the Nation.</p>
            <p>Evil manners produce good Laws, but the beſt Laws in time may grow ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolete; and ſuch is the wicked nature of Man, that when he cannot by force break through a Law, he will by fraud and tricks endeavour to evade it.</p>
            <p>I may with great truth affirm, the Common Law of <hi>England</hi> is the beſt Municipal Law in the World; and yet if the Legiſlative power were not ready to countermine the Works, and make up the Breaches that are daily made upon it, the ſons of <hi>Zeruiah</hi> would be too ſtrong for us.</p>
            <p>We have now preſented Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty with ſeveral Bills, for the Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law, which will ſerve to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54410:3"/>prune ſome exuberant branches, and to pull away the Ivie that robb'd this Tree of her juſt nouriſhment: And if Your Majeſty now be pleaſed graciouſly to ſhine upon her, ſhe will yield her fruit in great abundance, to the content of Your Majeſty, and all Your people.</p>
            <p>Coſmographers do agree, that this Iſland is incomparably furniſhed with pleaſant Rivers, like Veins in the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Body, which convey the Blood into all the parts, whereby the whole is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, and made uſeful: but the Poet tells us, he acts his part beſt,—<hi>Qui miſcuit utile dulci:</hi> Therefore we have prepared ſome Bills for making ſmall Rivers Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable: A thing that in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys hath been more experienced, and hath been found very advantagious; it eaſeth the people of the great Charge of Land-Carriages, preſerves the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, which are daily worn out with Waggons, carrying exceſſive Burthens; it breeds up a Nurſery of Watermen, which, upon occaſion, will prove good Sea-men; and with much facility main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54410:4"/>Intercourſe and Communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Cities and Countries.</p>
            <p>We have been much affected with the crys and wants of the Poor this hard ſeaſon, eſpecially thoſe about this Town, who are ready to ſtarve for want of Fuel, the price of Coals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo unreaſonably enhanſed by the extorting Engroſſers; VVe have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for their preſent and future eaſe, prepared a Bill, authorizing the Lord Mayor and the Court of Aldermen in the City of <hi>London;</hi> and Three Juſtices of Peace in the Countrey, whereof one to be of the <hi>Quorum,</hi> from time to time to ſet the Prices of Coals; having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Price paid to the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and other emergent Charges.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>Great SIR,</hi> having fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed our preſent Counſels, we hope Your Majeſty will give us leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn for a time into our Countreys, where, in our ſeveral Spheres, we ſhall be ready to ſerve You with our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and our Purſes, and alſo with our
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54410:4"/>Prayers to the Great God of Hoſts, that he will be pleaſed to ſtrengthen Your <hi>Hands</hi> in the day of Battell, and make Your Majeſty victorious over all Your Enemies both at home and abroad.</p>
